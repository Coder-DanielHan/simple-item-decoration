SimpleItemDecoration is a library for adding dividers and offsets to Android's RecyclerView using RecyclerView.ItemDecoration.

Decorations can be added to interior dividers between elements and start/end offsets. SimpleItemDecoration can be used with LinearLayoutManager or GridLayoutManager.

##Usage

SimpleItemDecoration includes six ItemDecorations: start, end, and divider decoration for linear RecyclerViews and start, end, and divider decoration for grid RecyclerViews. 

Instantiate one or more of these decoration and add to a standard RecyclerView.


##Linear Decorations

####DividerItemDecoration

`DividerItemDecoration` is used to add interior dividers to a linear RecyclerView. Its constructor takes in a divider as a Drawable.

```
recyclerView.setLayoutManager(new LinearLayoutManager(...));

Drawable dividerDrawable = ContextCompat.getDrawable(this, R.drawable.divider_sample);

recyclerView.addItemDecoration(new DividerItemDecoration(dividerDrawable));
```

####StartOffsetItemDecoration

`StartOffsetItemDecoration` is used to add an offset to the start of a linear RecyclerView. If the RecyclerView is oriented vertically, the offset will be added to the top of the RecyclerView. If the RecyclerView is oriented horizontally, the offset will be added to the lefthand side of the RecyclerView. Its constructor takes in an offset in pixels.

```
recyclerView.setLayoutManager(new LinearLayoutManager(...));

int offsetPx = 10;

recyclerView.addItemDecoration(new StartOffsetItemDecoration(offsetPx));
```

####EndOffsetItemDecoration

`EndOffsetItemDecoration` is used to add an offset to the end of a linear RecyclerView. If the RecyclerView is oriented vertically, the offset will be added to the bottom of the RecyclerView. If the RecyclerView is oriented horizontally, the offset will be added to the righthand side of the RecyclerView. Its constructor takes in an offset in pixels.

```
recyclerView.setLayoutManager(new LinearLayoutManager(...));

int offsetPx = 10;

recyclerView.addItemDecoration(new EndOffsetItemDecoration(offsetPx));
```

##Grid Decorations

####GridDividerItemDecoration

`GridDividerItemDecoration` is used to add interior dividers to a grid RecyclerView. Its constructor takes in horizontal and vertical dividers as Drawables, along with the number of grid columns.

```
int numColumns = 2;

Drawable horizontalDivider = ContextCompat.getDrawable(this, R.drawable.divider_horizontal);
Drawable verticalDivider = ContextCompat.getDrawable(this, R.drawable.divider_vertical);

recyclerView.setLayoutManager(new GridLayoutManager(..., numColumns));

recyclerView.addItemDecoration(new GridDividerItemDecoration(horizontalDivider, verticalDivider, numColumns));
```

####GridTopOffsetItemDecoration

`GridTopOffsetItemDecoration` is used to add an offset to the top of a grid RecyclerView. Its constructor takes in and offset in pixels and the number of grid columns.

```
int offsetPx = 10;
int numColumns = 2;

recyclerView.setLayoutManager(new GridLayoutManager(..., numColumns));

recyclerView.addItemDecoration(new GridTopOffsetItemDecoration(offsetPx, numColumns));
```

####GridBottomOffsetItemDecoration

`GridBottomOffsetItemDecoration` is used to add an offset to the bottom of a grid RecyclerView. Its constructor takes in an offset in pixels and the number of grid columns.

```
int offsetPx = 10;
int numColumns = 2;

recyclerView.setLayoutManager(new GridLayoutManager(..., numColumns));


recyclerView.addItemDecoration(new GridBottomOffsetItemDecoration(offsetPx, numColumns));
```
